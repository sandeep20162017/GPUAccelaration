**Title:** Advancing Financial Computational Efficiency: A Comparative Study of Native CPU Compilation vs. Amazon Cloud (NVIDIA GPU) Utilization

**Abstract:**

The financial sector, especially in the context of market risk assessment, heavily relies on computational applications. However, many of these applications are traditionally built on outdated CPU technology, leading to performance limitations. To address these limitations, financial institutions often resort to purchasing licenses for third-party grid applications like SGE (Sun Grid Engine) and Data Synapse. Additionally, high-performance computing (HPC) applications in this domain are typically developed using tools like the GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) or Windows C#, which lack support for advanced hardware technologies such as GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) or TPUs (Tensor Processing Units).

This research explores the challenges and opportunities in optimizing high-compute applications in financial computing. It investigates the utilization of NVIDIA CUDA on AWS GPU instances to overcome these challenges and improve performance significantly. The study focuses on performance benchmark comparisons between native CPU compilation and the substantial performance gains achieved through the utilization of Amazon Cloud (NVIDIA GPU) infrastructure, without the need for a modular language or Mojo.
## 2. Accelerating High-Performance Computing with GPUs on AWS

**GPU Architecture Overview:**

1. **Number of Cores:** Modern GPUs are designed with a massive number of cores, which are individual processing units responsible for executing tasks in parallel. These cores are organized into streaming multiprocessors (SMs) or compute units. For example, NVIDIA's high-end GPUs can have thousands of CUDA cores within multiple SMs.

2. **Memory Hierarchy:** GPU architecture includes multiple levels of memory hierarchy to efficiently manage data access:
   - **Global Memory:** This is the primary memory pool accessible by all cores. It stores data used by the entire GPU and has a relatively large capacity.
   - **Shared Memory:** Shared memory is a small, high-speed memory pool that can be accessed by threads within the same thread block. It is used for fast data sharing between threads.
   - **L1 and L2 Cache:** GPUs often have cache levels (L1 and L2) to reduce memory latency. These caches store frequently accessed data and instructions, accelerating memory access.

3. **Memory Bandwidth:** GPUs are equipped with high-memory bandwidth, which refers to the rate at which data can be read from or written to memory. This high memory bandwidth is crucial for handling large datasets efficiently.

**Contribution to GPU's Computational Power:**

1. **Parallelism:** The abundance of cores in a GPU enables massive parallelism. Each core can perform its calculations independently, allowing the GPU to handle thousands of parallel threads simultaneously. This parallelism is particularly advantageous for tasks like matrix multiplication, where many calculations can be executed concurrently, leading to significant speedup.

2. **Memory Hierarchy:** The memory hierarchy ensures efficient data access. Global memory provides a large storage capacity for data, while shared memory and caches reduce memory latency. This hierarchy minimizes the time cores spend waiting for data and maximizes computational throughput.

3. **Data-Parallel Processing:** GPUs are optimized for data-parallel processing, where the same operation is applied to multiple data elements simultaneously. This makes them well-suited for tasks that involve applying the same mathematical operations to large arrays or matrices, such as those encountered in financial computations.

4. **Specialized Hardware Units:** Modern GPUs may include specialized hardware units like Tensor Cores for accelerating specific types of computations, such as tensor operations commonly used in deep learning. These units further enhance computational power for specific workloads.

5. **High Memory Bandwidth:** The high memory bandwidth ensures that data can be fetched and processed quickly, reducing the time cores spend idle due to memory bottlenecks. This is crucial for tasks involving extensive data manipulation, such as matrix multiplications and complex financial calculations.

## 4. Experimental Results

To evaluate the performance enhancements achieved through Mojo in market risk assessment, we conducted a series of experiments focusing on optimizing matrix multiplication‚Äîa fundamental operation in financial computing.

### 4.1. Matrix Multiplication Performance Comparison
Matrix multiplication is a fundamental operation in many financial computations. Given two dense matrices ùê¥ and ùêµ of dimensions ùëÄ√óùêæ and ùêæ√óùëÅ, respectively, the goal is to compute their dot product ùê∂=ùê¥.ùêµ, also known as matmul. The dot product is defined as:

ùê∂ùëñ,ùëó+=‚àëùëò‚àà[0‚ãØùêæ)ùê¥ùëñ,ùëòùêµùëò,ùëó
